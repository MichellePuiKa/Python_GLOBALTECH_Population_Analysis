# Python_GLOBALTECH_Population_Analysis

## **1. Background and Overview**
As a Data Analyst applicant at GLOBALECH, a company renowned for its data analysis for government bodies.  This analysis used Python to analyse the population dataset from various contries and provide insights and suggested how GLOBALTECH might use them to inform decisions.


## **2. Data Source & Structure**
### **Data Source**
The data set provided in named population.csv.  It contains population data for various contries across multiple years, alongside metadata such as region and contry identifiers.


## **3. Executive Summary**
### **Key Findings**
- There were **59** countries with no population data in 2000
- Total population of **African Countries** in 2010 is **991 Millions**.  The population distribution is very extreme as Nigeria had the highest population with 140 Millions and the second highest population is Ehiopia which is 90 Millions
- Average population of **South American Countries** in 2000 was **24.5 Millions**
- **China & India** are the only two countries with population **exceeded 1000 Millions** in 2007, with 1310 and 1124 Millions of population respectively
- **Europe population** was **decreased by 8 Millions** from 714 to 706 Millions during 2000-2010
- The **Top 5 European Countries** with the highest population growth during 2000-2010 were: **Spain, France, United Kingdom, Ireland and Italy**

## **5. Recommendations**
- The population distribution is uneven and this could be due to the factors of the locations, weather, supporting facilities, transportation networks and wars
- Government bobies should take more research of finding the reasons of uneven population distribution and find the practical ways of encouraging people to live in the less population areas, such as provisions of health services, education facilities and housing plans
- In order to make accurate future planning for the population, it is crucial to encourage the government bodies to conduct the population censuses regularly
